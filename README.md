# Typing Speed Test

# [Live Demo](https://stalwart-concha-6fad81.netlify.app/)

## Project Overview

This Typing Speed Test application measures users' typing speed by calculating words per minute (WPM) as they type a displayed sentence. Itâ€™s a simple and interactive way to assess and improve typing efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, deployed on Netlify
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), deployed on Render
- **API Integration**: Fetch API to retrieve random sentences for typing tests from the backend

## How It Works

1. The frontend fetches a random sentence from the backend when the test begins.
2. Users type the sentence displayed, and their typing speed is calculated in real-time based on the time taken to complete the sentence.
3. Results display words per minute (WPM) upon completion.
